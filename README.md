Abstract  

Accurate object detection under adverse weather conditions is of paramount importance for autonomous vehicles to effectively perceive other road users within their environment. Despite the notable progress in object detection models, there remains an absence of a comprehensive framework for assessing the robustness of these models in adverse weather scenarios. In this paper we introduce  Scenario Attentional Score Aggregation(SaSa), a systematic methodology for evaluating an object detection model's overall robustness to adverse weather conditions, and KITTI-FRAS, a comprehensive weather dataset containing 24 bad weather scenarios. Leveraging the KITTI dataset, we construct and compile KITTI-FRAS, which encompasses 12,000 images and represents various severities of fog, rain, and snow. Subsequently, we train three classical object detection models (YOLOv7, SSD, and Faster R-CNN) and evaluate their overall performance on KITTI-FRAS using the proposed SaSa method. Our experimental findings demonstrate the effectiveness of SaSa and KITTI-FRAS as a benchmarking framework for comprehensively assessing a model's robustness to adverse weather conditions. We release the weather dataset and associated code at \url{https://github.com/hanyuesgithub/ObjectDetection-FRAS}. We hope that our research contributes valuable insights for advancing the development of robust object detection models in challenging environmental conditions.
